  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/ic_launcher_1.png
    - assets/images/ic_launcher_2.png
    - assets/images/unipark_logo.png
    - assets/images/google_logo.png

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Epilogue
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Epilogue-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: fonts/Epilogue-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: fonts/Epilogue-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: fonts/Epilogue-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
