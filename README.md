# unipark-uitm-app
UniPark@UiTM is my Final Year Project (FYP) for my Bachelor of Information Technology (Hons.) - UiTM. UniPark@UiTM is a parking finder mobile application which can help students in UiTM Shah Alam to navigate for parking spaces and get a real-time information about the parking spaces.
